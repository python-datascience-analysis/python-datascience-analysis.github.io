            This website has been created to hold my answers to Seminar question in 4th Year at Glasgow Caledonian University. This has been done to make viewing my work easier and promote my accountability. Thanks for visiting!

            I have used generative AI to helo me build this website. I didn't think it was against good use policy as it is a hosting platform and not part of my work. I hope you enjoy it all the same!
