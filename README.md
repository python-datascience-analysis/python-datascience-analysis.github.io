This is a space for the answers to University Seminars in my 4th Year. I aim to have this be an account of the work I done and it is also there for presentation purposes.
I have built a website with some help online from GenAI. I think this is suitable as the hosting of the website is not something that can directly contribute to my mark.
The project here will also keep me accountable during the weeks for my Seminar participation so I do not fall behind.
I have made my best effort for the website to be as useful and easily navigatable as possible.

The work presented on these websites is all my own and I have made minimal use of any GenAI sources. Mainly grammer help.
